      <h1>Introduction to the Night Fae Covenant</h1>
      <small>Ardenweald</small>
      <img src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/883642.jpg">
      <p>The Night Fae is one of the four Covenants. They serve as the Guardians of Nature and Shepherds of the Cycle of Life and Death. They play a role similar to that of the Kyrian on behalf of powerful nature spirits, guiding them to Shadowlands for rest and rebirth. It was through their aid that the demigod Cenarius was able to return to Azeroth during the events of the Cataclysm.</p>

      <p>Souls who are entrusted to the Night Fae have strong alignments to nature, elements, and natural cycles. While Druids seem like a natural fit, it is not limited only to members of that class, nor would all Druids be considered fit to join their ranks. Any character with a strong affiliation with the elements and and a desire to defend the forces of nature would be a welcome addition to the Night Fae.</p>

      <p>Ardenweald, dark mirror of the Emerald Dream, is the home of the Night Fae covenant. It is the third of the four Covenant realms (Bastion, Maldraxxus, Ardenweald, and Revendreth) that new players will quest through to gain the privilege of choosing a covenant at level 60.</p>
