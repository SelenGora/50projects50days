        <hr class="horizontal-line" />
        <p>
          Estinien Varlineau was quickly discovering the potency of Hannish
          spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back when the hunting of dragons consumed his every waking moment, he
          had seldom partaken of drink. Indeed, he might well have abstained
          completely were it not for the cajoling of a persistent friend. But
          having cast off the mantle of Azure Dragoon and taken to the road at
          the end of the Dragonsong War, he had been surprised to find that he
          rather looked forward to the reward of a drink in the evening. And
          this evening, he had met his match in a new variety of liquor.
          <em>More fire than water, this...</em> Trust an alchemist to concoct
          such stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          He followed his first sip with a strip of dried squid. Supplied by a
          local fisherman, the savory morsel was the equal of any he had tasted
          in the Far East. It served to settle the palate, and he dared to drain
          his cup of the rest of the fiery liquor, its warmth spreading through
          his body as he reclined in his lavish chamber in Radz-at-Han.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the exertions of his quest to the very edge of existence, life
          in the city as the satrap's honored guest suited Estinien well enough.
          Yet despite the lack of an impending threat, he continued to train as
          diligently as ever. He had taken up the lance that he might avenge
          himself upon Nidhogg for the murder of his family, and even having
          done so, found that a habit formed over a lifetime was not so easily
          shed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus did an old custom meet a new one, and after Estinien had trained
          to his satisfaction each day, he permitted himself the indulgence of a
          drink or two. But given the enthusiasm of the Hannish alchemists, only
          one was required on this occasion. He had scarcely savored a second
          strip of dried squid when exhaustion and liquor swept over him like a
          tide, gentle yet insistent, bearing him away to the land of slumber.

        <hr class="horizontal-line" />
        <p>
          Beyond the veil of consciousness, in the depths of dream, he was
          fighting a dragon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beast roared, and he felt its unbridled rancor as plainly as the
          stirrings of his own heart thanks to the Eye, the source of the Azure
          Dragoon's might. He leapt high to avoid his opponent's snapping maw,
          twisting in midair as he channeled the dread orb's power into his
          lance. Then, like a blazing meteor hurtling from the heavens, he
          plummeted back down to the earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lance found its mark, piercing the seam of scales along the
          dragon's neck and sinking deep into flesh, where it released its
          energy in a fiery explosion that shattered bone with a telltale crack.
          <em>Be still.</em>
